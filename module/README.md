## Folder Structure Conventions
- All building files must in Source folders:
  - In the root, place the module manifest.
    - In Public, place functions accessible by users.
    - In Private, place functions that inaccessible by users, e.g. helper functions.
    - Place one function per file, and file name must match the name of the function.
- In the root of the repository we have:
  - Debug-Tests.ps1, provides the full development "inner loop".  Hit F5.
  - Install-Requirements.ps1, installs all required modules for this module to be built, packaged and invoked.
